The Nobel Prize
First instituted in 1901, the Nobel Prize has been awarded to a total of 989 individuals (930 men and 59 women) and 30 organizations as of 2022.[1] Among the recipients, 12 are Indians of which 5 are Indian citizens and 7 are of Indian ancestry or residency. Rabindranath Tagore was the first Indian citizen to be awarded and also first Asian to be awarded in 1913. Mother Teresa is the only woman among the list of recipients.[2] Sri Aurobindo, the Indian poet, philosopher, nationalist and developer of Integral yoga, was nominated unsuccessfully for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1943 and for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950.[3][4]

On 1 December 1999, the Norwegian Nobel Committee confirmed that Mahatma Gandhi was nominated unsuccessfully for the Peace Prize five times (from 1937 to 1939, in 1947 and a few days before he was assassinated in January 1948).[5] In 2006, Geir Lundestad, the Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee, cited it as "the greatest omission in our 106-year history".[6][7][8]

Laureates
Two (Tagore and Raman) of the Nobel laureates are citizens of British India at the time they were awarded. Three (Teresa, Sen, and Satyarthi) of the Nobel laureates are citizens of India and four (Khorana, Chandrasekhar, Ramakrishnan, and Banerjee) were Indian by birth but subsequently non-citizens of India. One (Naipaul) is a Trinidad and Tobago born British Nobel laureate of Indian origin.

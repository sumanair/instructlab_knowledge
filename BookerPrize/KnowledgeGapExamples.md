│ The Booker Prize is one of the most prestigious international literary awards, recognizing excellence in fiction writing. Established in 1968 by Booker PLC, a British publisher, it was originally known as  │
│ the Booker-McConnell Prize and later simply as the Booker Prize. In 2003, the prize was renamed to the Man Booker Prize after being sponsored by financial services company Man Group. However, in 2016, Man  │
│ Group decided to step down as sponsor, and the award is now once again known as the Booker Prize.                                                                                                             │
